# RestaurantReviews-NLP
Created a Bag of Words NLP model to parse through restaurant reviews to predict good and bad reviews of 1000 entries. Cleaned the tsv with PorterStemmer method and tokenized each word into the sparse matrix that has a value for each unique word in each review entry. Used Naive Bayes to train the model with a training set of 800 reviews and a test test of 200 reviews. Out of 200 test entries, the model correctly classified 146 reviews and incorrectly classified 54 reviews. 

Working on to improve the accuracy rate of this bag of words model.
